Project type B: Discontinuous Galerkin methods for non-isothermal Darcy-Forchheimer flows

Goal: The goal of this project is to propose and analyze advanced discontinuous Galerkin 
(dG) discretization methods for the numerical modeling of the nonlinear Darcy-Forchheimer model coupled with the heat equation. 
The aim is to benefit from the high-level flexibility featured by dG schemes to obtain a precise approximation of 
the solution fields. The main features of the proposed discretization method will be 
assessed by a complete numerical investigation.
